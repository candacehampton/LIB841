		<h2> A reader's road to a dream job: Library Media Specialist! </h2>
		
			<p> My name is Candace and I'm so glad to meet you all. I am taking classes at <a href="https://www.eku.edu/">EKU</a> and working toward my Library Media specialist Certificate.
This career path only makes sense to me since it involves two things I love: Children and reading!!	From a very young age in 
elementary school I have always wanted to be a teacher.  When I started teaching, my first job was Kindergarten, which I taught for three years. I had also
dreamed to teach special education which I did for 11 years.  However, in the back of my mind and in my heart I have always loved reading and books.  Library Media
Specialist was a dream job for me.  We had an opening at my school, I prayed about it and went for it and got it! I am working through the classes while learning the 
job and I am very blessed to have this opportunity to hold this position. 		</p>

		<h2> Purpose of my page </h2>
		
			<p> I guess you are wondering why do I need <I>my own page.</I>  I am learning to create websites from HTML editors, so this is great practice for me. Once I become proficient in this area, 
I can then teach my students how to make their own webpages.  Then the possibilities are endless! Stay tuned to see what comes next...
