		<h1> About Me </h1>
		
			<p> I am married to my highschool sweetheart!  
We have been together for 22 years and married for 15 of those years. Even at the age of 16,
I knew I was going to marry him someday.  We waited until we both graduated from college 
and got started on our careers before we married and moved to his family farm.  Back then, 
we actually had cows, made our own feed and cut our own hay.  We just don't have the time 
for that now and I do miss it. 

<br> </br> 

I have always wanted to be a mother.  We prayed for our baby for years and as soon as I 
let go and gave my worries and wants to God, He blessed us with a beautiful baby girl.  All
children are miracles and she is ours.  I know I am bias but she is such a sweethearted, smart,
amazing girl.  She will do great things in this world. 

<br> </br> 

So here we are today, my family and I, living on the farm in Powell County (see map below).  We have a German
Shepherd named Molly and a miniature horse named Buster.  We are very blessed and I thank
God for His blessings and for my family daily.
