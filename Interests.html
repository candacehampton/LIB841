		<h1> Interests </h1>
		
			<p> I don't run my own business or belong to some club, but I do have several interests!
The first three columns in the table below are how I prioritize my life.  I was always taught
God first, then family, then work.  Everything else comes after. 			</p>

		<h2> God </h2>
		<p>Growing up, I absolutely loved staying with my grandmother (we called her granny). Every Saturday night
		I would stay with her and every Sunday morning we got dressed and went to church.  I loved Sunday school 
		and I have always felt peace at church.  At the age of 11, I was saved and baptized. I can't imagine
		a life where God is not the center and Jesus as my Savior. Now I take my little girl to church and my heart jumps
when she gets up and sings songs of praise to our Lord!		</p>

<h2> Family </h2>
<p>God first, then family. This makes sense to me since I wouldn't have my family, without God. Where I am from, family 
is important. I had an amazing childhood with two parents who love me and now love their grandchildren. I am 
close to my siblings and their families.  Most of my family lives nearby so we see each 
other often and are always availble to take care of one another. </p>

<h2> Work </h2>
<p>As mentioned on my home page, I have worked in education for 15 years. I started in Kindergarten, 
switched to special education and now I am in the Library Media Specialist position.  I have my 
dual certification in Elementary Education P-5 and Learning and Behavior Disorders P-12.  I have
my Master in Teacher Leader: Special Education.  I am now working under a provisional certificate
for LMS which means I am taking the classes while doing the job.  I have learned so much in my Library 
classes and I'm excited to continue next year, improving upon and implementing my new knowledge. My 
school babies deserve the best. </p>
